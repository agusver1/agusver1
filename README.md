Hello, I'm Agustin Vergniaud, a passionate learner and aspiring Data Scientist with a focus on Machine Learning. My GitHub is a testament to my journey of honing my skills in the realm of Python and R programming languages, showcasing my projects and contributions in the field.

As part of my continuous growth, I'm concurrently undertaking a 6-month Front End Development course at the prestigious National Technological University (UTN) in Argentina. This additional expertise will complement my data-driven skills and broaden my horizons in the tech industry.

I thrive on embracing emerging technologies, always eager to explore new programming languages and cutting-edge tools to stay at the forefront of innovation.

Beyond the realm of technology, I indulge in my hobby of learning languages. With fluency in English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch, I find immense joy in connecting with diverse cultures and communities.

Currently, I am furthering my education at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires, pursuing a degree in Industrial Engineering, which serves as a strong foundation for problem-solving and analytical thinking.
