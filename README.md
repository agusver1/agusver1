Hi I'm Agustin Vergniaud. I am currently developing my skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. My posted works are based on Pyhton and R programming languages.

In electronics, I work in Arduino Language. In my free time, sometimes I make projects in TinkerCAD (Arduino Circuit Interface), that I will also post.

I enjoy so much learning new technologies as time passes. This means I'm always open to new programming languages and technologies.

I speak 6 languages currently, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch. I hope I can outdo this number in programming languages.

Currently, I am at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires studying Industrial Engineering and I am director of the fundraising area of student branch IEEE Computer Society ITBA.
