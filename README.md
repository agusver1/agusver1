Hi I'm Agustin Vergniaud. I am currently developing my skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. My posted works are based on Pyhton and R programming languages.

I enjoy so much learning new technologies as time passes. This means I'm always open to new programming languages and technologies.

My hobby is learning languages, I speak English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch.

Currently, I am at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires studying Industrial Engineering.
